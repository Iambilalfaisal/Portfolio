PROJECTS

NucleusOne Platform

NucleusOne is a comprehensive business management platform that centralizes multiple integrated applications for organizations. I contributed to developing core features across various modules including TimeSheet-One, Project-One, Binary-One, and Ops-One. My responsibilities included building responsive user interfaces with React, developing secure backend APIs with .NET, and optimizing database queries in MSSQL. I also worked on integrating AI-powered features to enhance user experience and automate business processes.

TimeSheet-One Application

TimeSheet-One is a professional time tracking and project management platform designed to streamline team productivity. I was responsible for developing key features including real-time time tracking, attendance management, and comprehensive reporting dashboards. I built responsive React components, implemented secure authentication systems, and optimized database queries to ensure fast data retrieval.

Project-One Application

Project-One is a comprehensive project management and work item tracking system designed for agile development teams. I developed core features including work item management with hierarchical structures (Epic, Feature, User Story, Task), sprint planning and management, Kanban boards, backlog management, and comprehensive analytics dashboards. I built responsive React interfaces with TypeScript, implemented complex state management using Zustand and React Query, and developed RESTful APIs with .NET for work item operations.

Ops-One Application

Ops-One is a comprehensive operations management platform that streamlines asset tracking, expense management, and workflow automation for organizations. I was responsible for developing key features including complete asset lifecycle management with QR code tracking, automated expense processing with receipt scanning and approval workflows, reimbursement processing with digital receipt stamping, and comprehensive analytics dashboards. I built responsive React components with TypeScript, developed secure backend APIs with .NET, and implemented role-based access control for multiple user roles.

HR-One Application

HR-One is a comprehensive Human Resources Management System designed to streamline all HR operations for organizations. I developed core features including employee profile management with personal, job, financial, and document information, department and designation assignment with hierarchical structures, employment history tracking, attendance management for both admins and employees, and comprehensive HR dashboards with key metrics. I built responsive React interfaces with TypeScript, implemented secure authentication and authorization systems, and developed RESTful APIs with .NET for all HR operations.

AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis System

Developed a sentiment analysis system using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for classification tasks. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training with scikit-learn, and deployment of the model for real-time analysis. I implemented various algorithms and compared their performance to achieve optimal accuracy. The system was integrated into a web application using Python backend and React frontend, demonstrating end-to-end ML deployment capabilities.

RAG-Based Information Retrieval System

Explored and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enhance information retrieval capabilities. The project involved working with transformer architectures, fine-tuning language models, and building a system that combines retrieval and generation for accurate and context-aware responses. This project demonstrated advanced understanding of modern NLP techniques and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
